Title - Survival Prediction on Titanic Dataset

Data Source & Validation - 
Kaggle 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

In the following piece of code instead of implementing a single model on the dataset and calculating accuracy, I've implemented 8 predictive models and compared their accuracy among each other. 

The 8 models being : 
Random Forest, 
Decision Tree,
K Nearest Neighbors,
Stochastic Gradient Descent,
Logistic Regression,
Linear Support Vector Machine,
Perceptron,
Gaussian Naive Bayes.
